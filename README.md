# Simulating_Math_Problem

I'm trying to solve a math game problem for my class, what better way than to go over the top wasting time and sleep on making an extra python script to practice OOP and also help me solve the problem. 

## The math problem:

Player 1 says a number between 1 and 4.

Player 2 can add either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 to Player 1â€™s number.

Player 1 can then add either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 to Player 2â€™s number.

The game goes on, and whoever says 100 wins.

Is one player guaranteed to win? If so, what is the strategy?

## I discovered the strategy, not saying it because future classes could find this, and that breaks honor code ðŸ˜Ž
Feel free to use this script to play against player 1 or 2 though.
